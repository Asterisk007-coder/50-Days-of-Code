## Some info about how and why I started this challenge

### Rules :

You may have heard of the 100DaysOfCode challenge, the rules for this one are similar :

1. **At least** two hour of coding **daily**
2. Reading tutorial texts / watching videos do not count, unless needed for coding progress.
3. Implementating stuff for practice , solving unsolved problems, and trying out new problems counts.
4. My main fields of focus : Deep learning for now, may switch to Graphs and DP later.

### Why 50 Days ? Why not 100 ?

My last one was 40 days and i managed to reach Day 30. This time i am trying to do better.
Plus, it also aligns nicely with the end of July.
