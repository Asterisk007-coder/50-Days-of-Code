# 50-Days-of-Code

40 days of code, starting from 11th March , 2024 to 31st July, 2024

## Day 2: June 12, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Not much new code, just worked on hyperparameter tuning, and have an issue in the learning rate probably. (see how the loss shoots at step 1300? that's bad )
I will consult a friend and get back on it on Day 3.

**Thoughts** Today I had a tough day at work and slept early. Then woke up around 5 to get in my 2 hours of coding. This is not as easy as i thought lol.

## Day 1: June 11, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Wrote test loop for my GPT which adds two numbers. Right now performance is not good, just 60% accuraccy on adding single digit numbers.

**Thoughts** Today i managed to study ~10 hours and out of that put three towards coding. Though setting up the repo etc took way longer than i expected. Im excited to continue tomorrow as well, to fix this low score of my model.
