# 50-Days-of-Code

40 days of code, starting from 11th March , 2024 to 31st July, 2024

## Day 1: June 11, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Wrote test loop for my GPT which adds two numbers. Right now performance is not good, just 60% accuraccy on adding single digit numbers.

**Thoughts** Today i managed to study ~10 hours and out of that put three towards coding. Though setting up the repo etc took way longer than i expected. Im excited to continue tomorrow as well, to fix this low score of my model.
